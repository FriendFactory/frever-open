# Frever Open Source

Frever is a mobile avatar and content creation platform designed for expressive storytelling through custom 3D characters. Users can create avatars, style outfits, generate short-form video content, and engage in social interactions including chat and user feeds. Videos created with Frever have been shared externally and accumulated over **10+ billion views** across platforms.

The app contains in-app purchases (IAP), a dual-currency system, and a progression model built around seasons and season passes. Under the hood, Frever included a real-time Unity client, a fully modular avatar system, wardrobe and animation tools, and a scalable backend with CMS and asset pipeline integrations.

This open source release contains the complete Frever ecosystem: Unity client, backend, bridge, CMS, asset manager, and a wide array of production assets including 3D wardrobe packs, animation libraries, and shader libraries. It is intended for developers and researchers working on avatar systems, content creation pipelines, or social creative platforms at scale.
